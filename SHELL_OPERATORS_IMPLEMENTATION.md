# Shell Operators Implementation Complete

## Summary
We've successfully implemented support for shell operators (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `()`) in command-stream, allowing virtual commands like `cd` to work correctly with these operators.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Shell Parser (`src/shell-parser.mjs`)
- Tokenizes and parses shell commands with operators
- Handles `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `;` (semicolon), `()` (subshells)
- Supports pipes `|`, redirections `>`, `>>`, `<`
- Properly handles quoted strings and escaped characters
- Falls back to `sh -c` for unsupported features (globs, variable expansion, etc.)

### 2. ProcessRunner Enhancements (`src/$.mjs`)
- `_runSequence()` - Executes command sequences with proper operator semantics
- `_runSubshell()` - Handles subshell isolation (saves/restores cwd)
- `_runSimpleCommand()` - Executes individual commands (virtual or real)
- Integration with existing pipeline support

### 3. Fixed cd Command Behavior
- `cd` now works correctly in all contexts:
  - `cd /tmp` - changes directory (persists) ✓
  - `cd /tmp && ls` - both commands see /tmp ✓
  - `(cd /tmp && ls)` - subshell isolation ✓
  - `cd /tmp ; pwd ; cd /usr ; pwd` - sequential execution ✓

## How It Works

1. When a command contains operators, the enhanced parser parses it into an AST
2. The executor traverses the AST, respecting operator semantics:
   - `&&` - run next only if previous succeeds (exit code 0)
   - `||` - run next only if previous fails (exit code ≠ 0)
   - `;` - run next regardless
   - `()` - run in subshell with saved/restored directory
3. Virtual commands execute in-process, maintaining state
4. Real commands spawn subprocesses as needed
5. Falls back to `sh -c` for unsupported features

## Examples That Now Work

```javascript
// cd with && operator
await $`cd /tmp && pwd`  // Output: /tmp

// cd with || operator  
await $`cd /nonexistent || echo "failed"`  // Output: failed

// Multiple commands with ;
await $`cd /tmp ; pwd ; cd /usr ; pwd`  // Output: /tmp\n/usr

// Subshell isolation
await $`(cd /tmp && pwd) ; pwd`  // Output: /tmp\n<original-dir>

// Complex chains
await $`cd /tmp && git init && echo "done"`

// Nested subshells
await $`(cd /tmp && (cd /usr && pwd) && pwd)`  // Output: /usr\n/tmp
```

## Benefits

1. **Correct Shell Semantics** - cd and other virtual commands behave exactly like in a real shell
2. **Performance** - No subprocess overhead for simple command chains
3. **Cross-platform** - Consistent behavior across platforms
4. **Backward Compatible** - Existing code continues to work
5. **Graceful Fallback** - Complex shell features still work via `sh -c`

## Testing

All major shell operator scenarios are tested and working:
- ✓ AND operator (`&&`)
- ✓ OR operator (`||`)
- ✓ Semicolon operator (`;`)
- ✓ Subshells (`()`)
- ✓ Nested subshells
- ✓ Complex command chains
- ✓ Directory persistence
- ✓ Path with spaces

## Files Modified

1. `src/$.mjs` - Added sequence/subshell execution methods
2. `src/shell-parser.mjs` - New file for parsing shell operators
3. `src/commands/$.pwd.mjs` - Fixed to output newline
4. Various test and example files

## Future Enhancements

Possible future additions:
- Background execution (`&`)
- Here documents (`<<`)
- Process substitution (`<()`, `>()`)
- More complex redirections (`2>&1`, etc.)
