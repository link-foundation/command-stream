## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export COMMAND_STREAM_VERBOSE=true

# Run in CI mode
export CI=true
```

### Customizing Benchmarks
Edit benchmark files to adjust:
- **Iteration counts** - More iterations = more accurate results
- **Warmup rounds** - Reduce JIT compilation effects  
- **Test data sizes** - Adjust for your use case
- **Timeout values** - Prevent hanging on slow systems

### Adding New Competitors
To benchmark against additional libraries:

1. Install the competitor: `npm install competitor-lib`
2. Add implementation in relevant benchmark file
3. Update feature matrix in `features/feature-completeness-benchmark.mjs`

## 🤖 CI Integration

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Best Practices Tested
- **Streaming vs Buffering** - When to use each approach
- **Concurrent vs Sequential** - Optimal parallelization patterns
- **Memory Management** - Preventing memory leaks in long-running processes
- **Error Handling** - Fast vs robust error management strategies

### Optimization Insights
The benchmarks reveal:
- Stream processing is 2-5x more memory efficient for large data
- Built-in commands avoid process spawning overhead
- Concurrent execution scales well up to CPU core count
- Event patterns add minimal overhead vs direct awaiting

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Timeouts:**
- Increase timeout values for slow systems
- Skip heavy benchmark suites with `--skip-*` flags

**Memory Issues:**
- Use streaming benchmarks on systems with limited RAM
- Enable garbage collection with `--expose-gc` flag

**Permission Errors:**
- Ensure write access to `benchmarks/results/` directory
- Some tests create temporary files in `/tmp/`

**Missing Dependencies:**
- Install system tools: `jq`, `curl`, `grep`, `awk`
- Ensure Bun/Node.js versions meet requirements

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging for debugging
COMMAND_STREAM_VERBOSE=true npm run benchmark:features

# Run single test for debugging
cd benchmarks
node -e "
import('./features/feature-completeness-benchmark.mjs')
  .then(m => new m.default())
  .then(b => b.testBasicExecution())
  .then(console.log)
"
```
